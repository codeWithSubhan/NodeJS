// Consider modules to be the same as ReactJS node module.
// A set of functions you want to include in your application.
// Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
// some module are:-
// assert:	Provides a set of assertion tests
// buffer:	To handle binary data
// http:	To make Node.js act as an HTTP server

//  Include Modules
// To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:
// var http = require('http');
// Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:

// const fs = require('fs')

// 'fs':- modul which store many file system functions
// require():- function which is used to call fs modul and return object contain all it's function ðŸ˜‚
// fs:- object which store all ('fs' moduls) functions
