// NODEJS😍:- Is a JAVASCRIPT runTime, build on Google's V8 engine

// let's understand deeply about NODEJS 😎😎
// a Browser natively understand HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT
// every Browser has it's own engine to execute Javascript code
// like :-
// Google: V8
// Firefox: SpiderMonkey
// Microshoft Edge: chakra

// before 2009 JAVASCRIPT only 😥executed by Browser by it's own engine
// but can't be executed js code out the browser

// then in 2009 a programmer Ryan Dahl 🤔thought why can't we use js outside the browser.
// then he took V8 Google's engine which is fastest engine and combine it with c++ language
// and call it as NODEJS 😃

// And Now finally Javascript can be use in server-side language
console.log("Hello world 😀");

// What is a Node.js File?
// Node.js: files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
// A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
// Node.js: files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
// Node.js: files have extension ".js"

// Node.js uses asynchronous programming!
// NodeJS base on single thread keep in mind
